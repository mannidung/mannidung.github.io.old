Little progress today. I’m trying to get back into the algorithms and I’ve had to look through some of the old papers I used for my master’s thesis.

I think I’ve arrived to the correct version of the algorithm, but something is still wrong with the phase and with the fftshift. And I haven’t been able to bend my head around it. This means that I’ve coded a lot today with almost no progress, so almost nothing to show.

Anyhow: here’s an image at least, showing the status of the true object and the current guess after 1000 iterations. The similarity is… not present…
